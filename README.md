# restaurant-service
Restaurants, menus, food items

## Runtime

- Node.js 20 or newer
- TypeScript in strict mode
- Express 5
- Default local port: `8082`
- Health endpoints: `GET /health` and `GET /ready`

The shared workspace port registry is stored at
`implementation/SERVICE_PORTS.md` from the FoodPulse workspace root.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
npm start
```

Copy `.env.example` to the ignored `.env` file only when overriding local
configuration. The committed default already uses port `8082`.

Build output is written to `dist/`. Error responses have one common shape and
include the `x-request-id` value for tracing. Domain routes and external client
connections are intentionally left for the corresponding service implementation.
